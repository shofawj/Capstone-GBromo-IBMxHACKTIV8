## Gunung Bromo Visitor Sentiment Analysis Project using IBM Granite LLM

This project explores how tourists experience Gunung Bromo, one of Indonesia‚Äôs most iconic natural destinations, by analyzing publicly available Google Maps reviews using artificial intelligence.

Using IBM Granite ‚Äî a powerful large language model ‚Äî this project processes and interprets unstructured reviews to extract:
1. Sentiment (positive/negative/mixed)
2. Common complaints and praises
3. Provide actionable recommendations for tourism management
4. Visualize key trends in visitor feedback

The objective is to generate insights that can improve visitor satisfaction, identify pain points, and support data-driven decision-making in tourism management.

The analysis leverages IBM's Granite-3.3-8b LLM model through Replicate's API to perform sophisticated sentiment analysis and thematic extraction from review texts.
